# Topic 11: Outlier Detection in Urban Air Quality Using Mobile Sensor Networks

Focus: Exploring Machine Learning Techniques for Outlier Detection in Hyperlocal Air Quality Data from Moving Vehicles 

Compare algorithms such as Distance-based, density-based, LOF, One-Class SVM, local outlier factor 

Also, some of the following algorithms: Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine), Elliptic Envelope, Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD), Robust Covariance,  Mahalanobis Distance, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), Autoencoder-based methods.
