# instructions
## follow the following instructions
1. [ ] run the example starting code and familiarize yourself with some geosaptial processing techniques, including:
    - sampling
    - spatial join
    - geo-visualization

2. [ ] reference papers include:
    > [1. Large-Scale Outlier Detection for Low-Cost PM10 Sensors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9288694) 

3. [ ] start by performing Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA) for the data
    > for example
        - historgrams to study the distribution of data (you have three sensors)
        - ```Kernel Density (univariate, aspatial)```
        - get insights from the following:
    - [02_geovisualization](https://darribas.org/gds_scipy16/ipynb_md/02_geovisualization.html)
    - [Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA)](https://darribas.org/gds_scipy16/ipynb_md/04_esda.html)
    - [NYC Data](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Geospatial-Data-Science-Quick-Start-Guide/blob/master/Chapter02/NYC%20Data.ipynb)
    - [Performing Spatial operations like a Pro](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Geospatial-Data-Science-Quick-Start-Guide/blob/master/Chapter03/Chapter3.ipynb) such as ```Spatial join```

4. [ ] Use DBSCAN and methods described in the reference paper to detect outliers! Compare algorithms such as described in the paper!
